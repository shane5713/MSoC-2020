## 1. OVERVIEW

The DCT concentrates most of the pixels energy distribution into a few frequency coefficients. 
DCT is a valuable tool for pictures compression, when associated with Quantization and VLC. The transform itself does not compress images and it is accurately reversible. DCT is a separable transform: 2-D F-DCT and I-DCT can be done as consecutive 1-D transforms
